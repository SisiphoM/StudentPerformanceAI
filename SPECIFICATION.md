 # AI-Powered Student Performance Prediction System - Specification

## 1. Introduction

**Project Title:** AI-Powered Student Performance Prediction System  
**Domain:** Education & Learning Analytics  
**Problem Statement:**  
Many students struggle academically due to **lack of early intervention**. This system predicts their performance based on **grades, attendance, and study habits**, allowing educators to provide timely support.  

**Individual Scope:**  
The project is feasible due to:
- Availability of student data (grades, attendance records, learning patterns).
- Use of **machine learning algorithms** to make accurate predictions.
- Integration with school databases for real-time updates.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Student Data Collection:** Import grades, attendance, and study records.
- **AI Model Training:** Train machine learning models to predict student performance.
- **Report Generation:** Provide performance reports to students & educators.
- **Personalized Learning Suggestions:** Suggest improvement strategies.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Data Security:** Secure student data with encryption.
- **Scalability:** Handle thousands of student records.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use dashboard for teachers & students.

## 3. Assumptions and Constraints
- Students must have recorded grades & attendance.
- Schools must integrate their database with the system.

## 🔍 4. System Components & Architecture  

### **4.1 System Overview**  
- **Frontend:** A React-based web application for user interaction.  
- **Backend:** A Flask API handling data processing and ML model execution.  
- **Database:** Stores student data, reports, and login credentials.  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Predicts student performance trends.
