# Custom Kanban Board Setup

## **GitHub Project Board Creation**
- Created a GitHub **Automated Kanban** board in the repository.

## **Custom Columns Added**
- **Testing** – To track issues undergoing QA before release.
- **Blocked** – To highlight tasks that cannot proceed due to dependencies.

## **Tasks Added**
The board was populated with tasks from the **previous sprint plan (Assignment 6)**:
- Implement AI Model for Predictions
- Develop User Interface for Dashboard
- Integrate Student Database with Backend
- Fix Bug: Model Accuracy Drops on Large Datasets

## **GitHub Issues & Assignments**
- Linked existing **GitHub Issues** (user stories) to the board for better traceability.
- Assigned tasks to team members using `@mentions`.

This customized Kanban board improves **workflow visibility, task tracking, and efficiency** in managing the project's Agile sprints.
