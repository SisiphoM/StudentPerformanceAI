# Reflection: Balancing Stakeholder Needs

### Challenges Faced:
1. **Conflicting Priorities:**  
   - Students want **instant feedback**, but AI models require **time to process** accurate predictions.  
2. **Data Privacy Concerns:**  
   - Parents want **full access** to their childâ€™s data, but **privacy laws limit** what can be shared.  
3. **Scalability vs. Cost:**  
   - Schools want **AI predictions in real-time**, but **processing power is expensive**.  
4. **Technical Complexity:**  
   - IT staff need **a secure, scalable system**, but **maintaining AI models requires expertise**.  

### Solutions:
- **Compromises:** AI predictions update **every 24 hours** instead of instantly.  
- **Data Governance:** Parents can see **performance trends**, but not **raw student data**.  
- **Optimized Costs:** AI runs on **cloud-based GPUs** during peak times only.
