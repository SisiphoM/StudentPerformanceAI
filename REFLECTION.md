# Reflection: Balancing Stakeholder Needs

### Challenges Faced:
1. **Conflicting Priorities:**  
   - Students want **instant feedback**, but AI models require **time to process** accurate predictions.  
2. **Data Privacy Concerns:**  
   - Parents want **full access** to their childâ€™s data, but **privacy laws limit** what can be shared.  
3. **Scalability vs. Cost:**  
   - Schools want **AI predictions in real-time**, but **processing power is expensive**.  
4. **Technical Complexity:**  
   - IT staff need **a secure, scalable system**, but **maintaining AI models requires expertise**.  

### Solutions:
- **Compromises:** AI predictions update **every 24 hours** instead of instantly.  
- **Data Governance:** Parents can see **performance trends**, but not **raw student data**.  
- **Optimized Costs:** AI runs on **cloud-based GPUs** during peak times only.  

# Reflection: Challenges in Use Case Modeling & Testing

### **Challenges Faced**
1. **Translating Requirements into Use Cases**  
   - Some stakeholder concerns were broad, requiring careful breakdown into clear use cases.
2. **Handling Alternative Flows**  
   - Predicting edge cases (e.g., missing data) was tricky.
3. **Designing Meaningful Test Cases**  
   - Ensuring test cases matched requirements was challenging.

### **Lessons Learned**
- Clearly defining **preconditions and postconditions** helps structure use cases.  
- Test cases should be designed **alongside requirements** to ensure full coverage.  
- **Stakeholder collaboration** ensures all needs are addressed properly.

# Reflection: Challenges in Agile Planning  

### **1. Prioritization Challenges**  
- Some user stories felt equally important, making MoSCoW prioritization difficult.  
- Solution: Focused on **core functionalities first** (performance reports, user management).  

### **2. Effort Estimation Issues**  
- Assigning **story points** was tricky without exact workload details.  
- Solution: Used the **Fibonacci sequence** for rough estimation.  

### **3. Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs**  
- Balancing **technical complexity vs. user needs** was tough.  
- Solution: Ensured that **must-have** stories addressed key stakeholder concerns.  

### **4. Planning Dependencies**  
- Some tasks required system integration before they could be tested.  
- Solution: Scheduled **integration tasks** early in the sprint.  

### **Lessons Learned**  
- **Break down large tasks** into smaller, testable increments.  
- **Use backlog prioritization** to ensure MVP is functional ASAP.  
- **Plan for dependencies early** to avoid blockers.
