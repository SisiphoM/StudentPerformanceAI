# Kanban Board Explanation

## **What is a Kanban Board?**
A Kanban board is a **visual project management tool** used to track tasks across different workflow stages in Agile development. It consists of columns representing different phases of work, such as:

- **To Do**: Tasks waiting to be started.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Review**: Tasks under verification before release.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

Kanban boards help teams **monitor task progress, prioritize work, and optimize efficiency**.

## **How Our Kanban Board Supports Agile Principles**
Our customized **Automated Kanban Board** aligns with Agile methodologies in the following ways:

### ✅ **1. Visualizes Workflow**
- Tasks move through columns, making **progress clear at a glance**.
- Example: If an issue is "In Progress," it appears in that column for easy tracking.

### ✅ **2. Limits Work-in-Progress (WIP)**
- Each column has a **maximum number of tasks allowed at a time**, ensuring efficiency.
- Example: Our "In Progress" column has a **WIP limit of 3 tasks**, preventing overload.

### ✅ **3. Enhances Adaptability & Continuous Improvement**
- **New issues can be added anytime** without disrupting ongoing work.
- Tasks are **reprioritized dynamically** to accommodate urgent issues.
- Example: If a **critical bug** is discovered, it is **moved to the top of the backlog**.

## **Example Usage of Our Kanban Board**
**Scenario:**  
*"A developer can only pick a new task from 'To Do' after completing one from 'In Progress' and moving it to 'Review.' This structure ensures continuous task flow without overwhelming the team."*

By using **Kanban principles**, our project ensures **better task management, smooth workflow, and higher efficiency**.
