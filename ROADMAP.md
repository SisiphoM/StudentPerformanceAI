## üìç Project Roadmap: StudentPerformanceAI

The purpose of this roadmap is to provide a high-level view of the development plan for the `StudentPerformanceAI` system. This project aims to predict student performance using AI, supporting educational institutions in making data-driven interventions.

---

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Architecture & Functionality (‚úîÔ∏è Completed)
- [x] Define domain model (`Student`, `Grade`, etc.)
- [x] Implement creational design patterns (Factory, Singleton, etc.)
- [x] Create in-memory repository and repository interfaces
- [x] Develop service layer (student logic and business rules)
- [x] Build REST API using FastAPI
- [x] Write unit tests for each layer
- [x] Create example script (`run_example.py`)

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 2: Infrastructure & CI/CD (‚úîÔ∏è Completed)
- [x] Add `.env` configuration and VSCode settings
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions for test automation
- [x] Enforce branch protection rules (`PROTECTION.md`)
- [x] Create release artifacts via workflow
- [x] Create developer documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`)

---

### üöß Phase 3: Future Enhancements (‚è≥ In Progress)
- [ ] Add database-backed repository implementation (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization (JWT / OAuth)
- [ ] Introduce role-based access (Admin, Teacher, Student)
- [ ] Extend API to manage courses, assessments, and interventions
- [ ] Add AI model training and prediction modules
- [ ] Integrate dashboard for data visualization (Plotly/Dash)

---

### üåê Phase 4: Community & Collaboration
- [ ] Add issue templates and pull request templates
- [ ] Tag beginner-friendly and high-priority issues
- [ ] Accept contributions and conduct code reviews
- [ ] Publish documentation site (e.g., with MkDocs or GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Create demo video or screencast for contributors
